Hello World!
This project is about how to create a git repository:
Create a directory to contain the project.
Go into the new directory.
Type git init .
Write some code.
Type git add to add the files (see the typical use page).
Type git commit .
You can also create a file in atom that will help you to create more than 2 files in one folder.
